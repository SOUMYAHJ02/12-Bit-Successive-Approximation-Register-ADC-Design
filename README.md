12-Bit Successive Approximation Register ADC Design in UMC 180nm Technology
• Enhanced 12 bit SAR ADC architecture by incorporating binary weighted Capacitive
DAC , resulting in improvement of signal accuracy and overall system latency. archi-
tecture.
• Improved sample and hold circuit performance by implementing bootstrapping action,
which reduced distortion by 20% and increased speed by 5% with no additional power
consumption, meeting crucial industry standards
